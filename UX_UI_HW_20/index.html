          <p>
            As Ux/Ui Designers we were tasked to find, contact, and redesign a local Denver, CO non profit company's website. With a personal connections to one of our group members, we reached out to Denver Cat Company  to complementary provide insight into their user experience. Luckily, they had posted on Instagram, that they were looking for a new website design.

          <h3>The Solution:</h3>
          <p>
            Our product was designed to align with their owner, Leila's, mission; “Leila's vision was that of a cozy coffee house with mellow music, books, and comfy chairs, an environment where students, remote workers, families, couples, and friends could all feel at home… with the addition of friendly cats to make everything feel even cozier.“

          <h3>My Role:</h3>
          <p>
            During this project the initial homepage design was really my baby and it was extra disappointing to be rejected for a user centered design. It was my idea to make the website look like the store front and use the door and windows as the menu options with CTAs. This was because users shared that they identified the building before the name of the company.

That vision “was that of a cozy coffee house with mellow music, books, and comfy chairs, an environment where students, remote workers, families, couples, and friends could all feel at home.” Our team's design drew from the Denver Cat Co. store front and allowed users to feel familiar and more at ease with the process of adopting a cat.</p>

              <p class="card-text">After meeting with our stakeholder, Leila, she had shared interest in a polished, sophisticated, and slick website design. Unfortunately, she was uninterested in the user insight we had provided and shared that she was restricted to squarespace to create the site itself. Leila was unable to give detailed information due to her busy schedule so our team struggled to convey our design convincingly.</p>
